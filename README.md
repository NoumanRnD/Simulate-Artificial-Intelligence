# Objective <br/>
1 Create and use trees <br/>
2 Simulate Artificial Intelligence<br/>

# Instructions<br/>
Develop a java program that learns about a universe of your choice by asking the user yes/no questions.<br/>
Universe Knowledge Base<br/>
Develop a program that begins with minimal knowledge. When the program incorrectly guesses an<br/>
answer, it asks for the answer and asks for a way to identify the item. The program builds a binary tree<br/>
of questions and items. A YES response to a question is stored in the question’s left child while a NO<br/>
answer is stored in the question’s right child.<br/>
The following is an example of the dialog for a universe of animals.<br/>
Think of an animal and I will guess it.<br/>
Does it have legs? YES<br/>
Is it a cat? YES<br/>
